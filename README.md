The game is a memory card game that is played on a 4 by 4 square grid, totaling 16 squares. Each square on the grid contains a card that is initially face-down. The objective of the game is to flip over two cards at a time, with the goal of finding pairs of cards that have the same color.

Here are the key rules and mechanics of the game:

Objective: The main goal of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same color.

Game Board: The game board is a 4 by 4 grid, resulting in 16 face-down cards initially.

Flipping Cards: The player can flip over any two cards on the board, but they can only flip one card at a time. This means they need to remember the colors of the cards they have seen to make matches.

Matching Pairs: When the player flips two cards, if those two cards have the same color, the player earns a point, and the matched pair of cards is removed from the board.

Mismatched Pairs: If the two cards flipped by the player have different colors, the player loses a point, and the cards are flipped face-down again.

Time Delay: After the player flips two cards, there is a two-second delay before the result is revealed. During this time, the player cannot flip any additional cards.

Game Continues: The game continues until the player successfully matches all pairs of cards on the board. The player's score is based on the number of correctly matched pairs.

The challenge in the game lies in remembering the colors of the cards that have been revealed and strategically flipping cards to find matching pairs while avoiding mismatched pairs. The player's memory and pattern recognition skills are put to the test as they aim to maximize their score by finding all pairs of cards with the same color.
